    '<p style="max-width:800px">For at least the past two years, Bill Douthit didn’t know he was driving on a cracked bridge twice a day.</p>'+
    '<p style="max-width:800px">Douthit, 56, of Arkansas, is a trucker. He drives shipping containers across the Mississippi River into Tennessee.</p>'+
    '<p style="max-width:800px">There are only two bridges linking his state to Tennessee, but after a crack was discovered this summer in the Interstate 40 bridge between Memphis, Tenn., and Little Rock, Ark., one was closed for months. Transportation officials would later say that images of the crack had circulated since 2019, but inspectors didn’t flag the danger until May of this year.</p>'+
    '<p style="max-width:800px">Douthit still has to drive over the Mississippi twice a day, and he saw his commute times double because every car that needed to cross the bridge into Tennessee was crammed onto the only working bridge. A normal trip across the bridge used to take 14 minutes, but for the three months that the second bridge was closed, it took much longer, he said.</p>'+
    '<p style="max-width:800px">“All these little hold-ups are killing the truck drivers,” he said in an interview before the bridge fully reopened this month. “My first trip, I ran the speed limit all the way through there. My second trip today, it took me about 50 minutes.”</p>'+

  '<p>Douthit’s commute issue is playing out for drivers across the Mississippi River Valley, where 131 bridges span the river. Dozens of the bridges are listed as in poor condition, according to data from the U.S. Department of Transportation.</p>' +
  '<p>The problem, experts said, is that these bridges were built before some areas along the Mississippi saw a surge in population growth. Many of the bridges in the U.S. weren’t future-proofed during construction to accommodate a growing population, experts said.</p>' +
  '<p>In the Memphis metropolitan area, where the I-40 bridge is located, the population swelled from 900,000 to 1.3 million between 1973, when bridge construction was completed, and this year, according to data from the Federal Reserve System.</p>'+
  '<p>“These bridges were not designed for that amount of traffic,” said Adel Abdelnaby, a civil engineering professor at the University of Memphis who researches the stability and vulnerability of structures. He also added that another reason the bridge cracked was because the structure was designed in the 1960s with aesthetics in mind.</p>'+
  '<p>“The M-shaped bridge is not the ideal system for [a bridge of] that length,” he said. “They wanted the bridge to have an M for Memphis.”</p>'

  '<p>Experts said that federal and state officials do not allocate enough money to pay for bridge inspections across the country. That decision may have helped lead to the August 2007 collapse of Bridge 9340 over the Mississippi River in Minneapolis.</p>'+

  '<p class="imageCredit"><i>Image credit:</i> <a href="http://npr.org">NPR</a></p>' +
  '<p>Thirteen people died and 145 people were injured in the rush-hour disaster. Inspectors from the National Transportation Safety Board determined that two factors contributed to the collapse: a plate that connected beams to the bridge columns was too thin, and the bridge wasn’t built to sustain the increased traffic flow of the early 2000s.</p>'

let divChapter2b =
  '<p>Federal lawmakers this summer passed a landmark $1 trillion infrastructure bill, which includes bridge funding that may help prevent a disaster like the one in Minneapolis.</p>' + 
  '<p>The bill earmarks $40 billion for “bridge repair, replacement, and rehabilitation.” This funding will also be used to help bridges withstand the effects of climate change. This transportation investment is the country’s largest since the federal government provided funding in 1956 to construct the Interstate Highway System.</p>' +
  '<p>This investment in repairing bridges is especially important, Abdelnaby said, because government officials don’t prioritize the maintenance of old bridges.</p>' + 
  '<p>“They always talk about new stuff, new roads, and they really don’t pay good attention to existing infrastructure,” he said.</p>'
