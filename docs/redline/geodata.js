All of the houses therein are modest cottages, housing workers from the large flour mill on the south of it, the canning plant on the west of it, and the packing plant and stockyards on the north. The chief detrimental influence is the packing plant. Some of the security consists of brick cottages, but most of it is made up of modest frame houses. Although the area is anything but a good residential section, it is considered a good lending territory because residents are usually employed in the adjoining industrial plants."
